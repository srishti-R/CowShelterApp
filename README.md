# CowShelterApp
This app is a goodwill gesture intended for a nearby cow shelter because there is no systematic way to direct people who come to feed the cows to the sheds properly. Because the workers may not be able to read in either hindi or english, this app has to be made purely using graphics, so that it is visually intuitive to use.
